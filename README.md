# Snake Game(Tournament Version)

We are able to make a software where different players can play the single game & after their score submission, their corresponding ranks can be calculated. This software is so useful and we tried our best to make it comfortable for all users. It took 2 months to build our software. During this tenure, we have faced a numerous errors and bugs. But finally, we made it possible. Our goal is to provide a pc game for gaming players and make them compete each other by submitting their respective scores. As of now, this software is an offline software, means no internet connection is required.
